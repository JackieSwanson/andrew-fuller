        "question": "What books would you recommend on the process of writing church history?",
        "answer": "The best resource is James E. Bradley and Richard A. Muller, Church History (Eerdmans, 1995). Also see Gord Heath, Doing Church History (Clements Publishing, 2008). Then I also recommend Nancy Vyhmeister, Quality Research Papers (Zondervan, 2001)."

        "question": "Which translation of the Bible did our Baptist forefathers use?",
        "answer": "The earliest Baptists in the seventeenth century used the Geneva Bible, and then after the 1650s the AV/KJV. But there is clear evidence that the Geneva Bible was still being used well into the 18th century. Fuller appears to have used the AV/KJV though he was quite able to make his own translations."

        "email": "nate@bishop.me",
        "question": "If you had to pick four books on baptism, which ones would you tell people to read?",
        "answer": "Well, first of all David Kingdon, Children of Abraham: A Reformed Baptist View of Baptism, The Covenant, and Children (Haywards Heath, Sussex: Carey Publications, 1973). It is out of print, but it the best twentieth-century study of baptism from a Reformed and Baptist perspective. Paul K. Jewett, Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publ. Co., 1978) is a similar study and also well worth reading. It too is out of print. There are older works, by authors like Alexander Carson, that are worthwhile, but these two are the best from the past century. <br> Then, for historical discussions of early Christian baptism I would recommend two small books: Hendrick F. Stander and Johannes P. Louw, Baptism in the Early Church (Leeds: Reformation Today Trust, 2004) is a gem and F.M. Buhler, Baptism: Three Aspects (Dundas, Ontario: Joshua Press, 2004) a much-overlooked piece that helpfully deals with the archaeological evidence pertaining to early Christian baptismal practice."
