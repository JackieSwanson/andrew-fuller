              <h2>Joy Unspeakable and Full of Glory: the Piety of Samuel and Sarah Pearce/h2>
              <p>
                Pearce was described by his friend Andrew Fuller as another Brainerd. He was one of the intimate circle of friends that included Fuller, John Sutcliff and William Carey. This book examines the piety of Samuel and his wife Sarah through their letters.

              <h2>Tri-Unity: An Essay on the Biblical Doctrine of God</h2>
              <p>
                In this new work by Dr. Michael A.G. Haykin on this bedrock doctrine of the Christian Faith, follow some of the greatest figures in the Ancient Church — men like the missionary theologian Ireanaeus of Lyons, the African bishop Athanasius and the monastic reformer Basil of Caesarea — as they study the Bible, grapple with how to talk about the Triune God and determine what exactly this means for the Christian life.

              <p>

              <h2>Rediscovering the Church Fathers: Who They Were and How They Shaped the Church </h2>
              <p>
                This book is an organized and convenient introduction to how to read the church fathers from AD 100 to 500. Michael Haykin surveys the lives and teachings of seven of the Fathers, looking at their role in such issues as baptism, martyrdom, and the relationship between church and state. Ignatius, Cyprian, Basil of Caesarea, and Ambrose and others were foundational in the growth and purity of early Christianity, and their impact continues to shape the church today.

              <h2>The Empire of the Holy Spirit</h2>
              <p>
                combines both keen historical reflection and rich biblical insight.  In this volume, Michael Haykin has pulled from his expertise in both church history and biblical spirituality.  If you would like to listen to the author’s own thoughts on the book, you can download this podcast in which Dr. Haykin is interviewed about this volume.

              <h2>Soldiers of Christ: Selections from the Writings of Basil Manly, Sr., & Basil Manly, Jr. </h2>
              <p>
                presents a collection of the sermons and tracts, hymns and confessional statements, letters and diaries, of Basil Manly, Sr. and his son Basil Manly, Jr. who both played vital roles in shaping a number of the central institutions of the Southern Baptist community in its formative years in the nineteenth century. Here we have a wonderful window onto the vista of nineteenth-century Southern Baptist life with all of its glorious strengths as well as its clear failings.

              <h2>The Christian Lover:  The Sweetness of Love and Marriage in the Letters of Believers</h2>
              <p>
                Dr. Michael A.G. Haykin brings together letters from one or both parties in twelve significant relationships from church history. The correspondents include such notables as Martin Luther (writing to his wife Katie), and John Calvin (expressing to friends his grief over the death of his wife Idelette). Lesser-known writers include Helmuth von Moltke, who wrote to his wife as he faced execution as the hands of the Nazis in 1945. The contents range from courtship communications to proposals of marriage to final words before dying, but most have to do with the events of everyday life. Dr. Haykin provides an introduction to each set of letters and draws practical applications for today’s believers based on the expressions of love made by the correspondents. In the end, The Christian Lover is a celebration of marriage, an intimate window into the thoughts of men and women in love with both God and one another.

              <h2>The Advent of Evangelicalism:  Exploring Historical Continuities </h2>
              <p>
                is a thorough analysis of David Bebbington’s 1989 book, Evangelicalism in Modern Britain: A History from the 1730s to the 1980s which put forth the idea that evangelical religion is the result of transatlantic revival in the 1730s, and that it took a working together attitude toward the Enlightenment rather than a contradictory one. Today, Bebbington’s thesis has gained international acceptance, and scholars from Europe and North America present a review of its primary arguments and conclusions here in The Advent of Evangelicalism (B&H Academic, 2008).

              <h2>Christ is All:  The Piety of Horatius Bonar</h2>
              <p>
                highlights the life and work of the memorable Scottish minister and poet, Horatius Bonar (1808–1889). Michael A. G. Haykin and Darrin R. Brooker present 65 excerpts from Bonar’s writings that capture his ardent devotion to the glory of Christ. Readers will also find Haykin’s biographical introduction on Bonar a valuable glimpse at a life that God used greatly in the preaching of the gospel and the saving of souls.
